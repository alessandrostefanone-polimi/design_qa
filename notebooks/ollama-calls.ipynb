       "'<think>\\nWe are going to write a function that:\\n 1. Takes an input number (let\\'s call it n)\\n 2. Finds the largest prime number less than n (the smaller one)\\n 3. Finds the smallest prime number greater than n (the larger one)\\n\\n Steps:\\n - We need a helper function to check if a number is prime.\\n - We\\'ll iterate from n-1 downwards until we find a prime (for the smaller one)\\n - Then we\\'ll iterate from n+1 upwards until we find a prime (for the larger one)\\n\\n Note: We have to be cautious for the case when n is prime? But the problem says \"one smaller and one larger\", so if n is prime then we want the next prime above and the previous prime below.\\n\\n However, note: the problem says \"the two closest prime numbers to it: one smaller and one larger\". So even if n is prime, we still want the next prime above and the previous prime below.\\n\\n Example: \\n   n = 10 -> previous prime is 7, next prime is 11.\\n\\n But note: what if n is 2? Then the previous prime doesn\\'t exist? However, the problem says \"closest prime numbers to it\", so we assume n is at least 3? \\n But the problem doesn: we have to handle numbers that might be less than 2? \\n\\n Let\\'s assume the input number is at least 2? \\n\\n However, the problem says: \"an input number\". We\\'ll design for positive integers.\\n\\n Approach for the prime check function (is_prime):\\n   - If number < 2: not prime.\\n   - If number == 2: prime.\\n   - If even: not prime (except 2).\\n   - Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)\\n\\n Steps for the main function:\\n   def find_closest_primes(n):\\n        # Find the smaller prime (less than n)\\n        smaller = n - 1\\n        while smaller >= 2:\\n            if is_prime(smaller):\\n                break\\n            smaller -= 1\\n        # If we didn\\'t find any prime below n? Then n is 2? But then we break at 2. But if n is 2, then smaller=2? Actually, we start at n-1 which is 1 -> then 1 is not prime, then 0 -> not prime -> then we break? But then we have to handle the case when n==2? \\n        # Actually, the problem says \"closest\", so we assume n is at least 3? But to be safe, we\\'ll handle n=2.\\n\\n        # Similarly for larger.\\n\\n        # However, the problem doesn\\'t specify the range. Let\\'s assume n>=2.\\n\\n        # Let\\'s write the helper is_prime and then the main.\\n\\n   But note: the problem says \"prints the two closest prime numbers\". So we can output: \\n        print(f\"Smaller: {smaller}, Larger: {larger}\")\\n\\n   However, the problem says: \"prints the two closest prime number to it: one smaller and one larger\"\\n\\n   We\\'ll do:\\n\\n        larger = n + 1\\n        while larger <= (some big number): # but we don\\'t have a big number? We can break when we find one? \\n            if is_prime(larger):\\n                break\\n            larger += 1\\n\\n   But what if n is very large? We don\\'t want to go too far? However, the problem doesn\\'t specify, so we assume n is not extremely large.\\n\\n   Alternatively, we can use a known prime sieve? But the problem says \"a function\", so we do simple.\\n\\n   However, note: the problem says \"two closest\". So we want the immediate next and immediate previous.\\n\\n   Let\\'s code:\\n\\n   Steps:\\n     1. Write is_prime(n)\\n     2. Write find_closest_primes(n)\\n\\n   But note: the problem says \"prints\", so we can do:\\n\\n        def find_closest_primes(n):\\n            # Find the smaller prime\\n            smaller = n - 1\\n            while smaller >= 2:\\n                if is_prime(smaller):\\n                    break\\n                smaller -= 1\\n            # Now find larger\\n            larger = n + 1\\n            while True:\\n                if is_prime(larger):\\n                    break\\n                larger += 1\\n\\n            print(f\"Smaller prime: {smaller}, Larger prime: {larger}\")\\n\\n   However, what if n is 2? \\n        smaller: starts at 1 -> not prime -> then 0 -> not prime -> then we break? Then smaller becomes 0? But 0 is not prime and we break the loop without finding? Then we have a problem.\\n\\n   We must ensure that for n=2, we have a prime below? Actually, the prime numbers start at 2. So for n=2, the previous prime doesn\\'t exist? But the problem says \"the two closest prime numbers to it\". \\n\\n   Let\\'s check the problem: it says \"one smaller and one larger\". So for n=2, there is no prime smaller than 2? Then we have to handle that.\\n\\n   Similarly, for n=1: no prime below 1? \\n\\n   We\\'ll assume the input n is at least 2.\\n\\n   But the problem doesn\\'t specify. So to be safe, we can do:\\n\\n        If n < 2: then we can\\'t have a prime below? Then we might print only the larger? But the problem says \"two\". \\n\\n   Since the problem says \"an input number\", and we are to write a function that prints two primes, we assume n>=3? \\n\\n   However, let\\'s read the problem: it says \"the two closest prime number to it: one smaller and one larger\". So if n is 2, then the smaller prime doesn\\'t exist? But the problem doesn\\'t specify the domain.\\n\\n   We\\'ll design for n>=2.\\n\\n   For n=2:\\n        smaller: we start at 1 -> not prime -> then 0 -> not prime -> then we break the loop without finding? Then we have to set smaller to None? But the problem says \"prints the two\", so we must have two.\\n\\n   Alternative: the problem might expect that for n=2, the smaller prime is 2? But wait, the problem says \"one smaller\" meaning strictly smaller? \\n\\n   Clarification: \\n        \"closer\" meaning the prime numbers that are closest to n. So for n=2, the primes are: ... 2 is prime. Then the next prime above is 3? and the prime below? there is none? \\n\\n   So the problem might be defined for n>=3? \\n\\n   Given the problem statement, I think we\\'ll assume n>=3. But the problem says \"an input number\", so we have to handle at least n=2.\\n\\n   Let\\'s change the requirement: \\n        The problem says: \"one smaller and one larger\". So if there is no smaller prime, then we skip? But the problem says \"two\".\\n\\n   To be safe, we\\'ll write the function for n>=2 and handle the edge cases.\\n\\n   Steps for n=2:\\n        smaller: we want a prime less than 2 -> there is none. So we can set smaller to None? But the problem says \"prints the two\", so we have to have two.\\n\\n   Alternatively, the problem might mean the closest primes that exist? \\n\\n   Since the problem is for a programming exercise and they want an example at the end, we can do:\\n\\n        We\\'ll assume the input n is at least 3.\\n\\n   But the problem says: \"an input number\". So let\\'s do:\\n\\n        If n == 2:\\n            smaller = None\\n            larger = 3\\n        But then we have to print one? \\n\\n   However, the problem says: \"prints the two closest prime number to it: one smaller and one larger\"\\n\\n   So we\\'ll do:\\n\\n        We\\'ll write the function to work for n>=2, and for n=2 we output:\\n            Smaller prime: (none) -> but the problem says two, so we don\\'t have two.\\n\\n   Given the ambiguity, and the problem says \"include a brief example\", we can choose an example that is safe.\\n\\n   Let me choose the example: n=10\\n\\n   So we\\'ll write the function for n>=3? \\n\\n   But the problem doesn\\'t specify the input range.\\n\\n   I propose: \\n        We\\'ll write the function to handle n>=2, and if the smaller prime doesn\\'t exist (for n=2) then we print \"Smaller prime: None\" but the problem says two. \\n\\n   Alternatively, we can define that the closest primes are the primes that are adjacent to n? and if there\\'s no prime below, then we only print the larger? But the problem says two.\\n\\n   After re-thinking: the problem says \"the two closest prime numbers to it\". So for n=2, the prime numbers that are closest are [2] (itself) and then the next prime is 3? but the problem says \"one smaller and one larger\", meaning distinct from n? \\n\\n   Actually, the problem says: \"one smaller and one larger\". So they are distinct from n.\\n\\n   Therefore, for n=2, there is no prime smaller than 2? so we cannot print two.\\n\\n   Since the problem says \"an input number\", and we are to write a function, we\\'ll assume the input is at least 3.\\n\\n   How about we do:\\n\\n        If n < 2: then we print an error? But the problem says \"input number\", so we assume integer >=2.\\n\\n   We\\'ll do:\\n\\n        def find_closest_primes(n):\\n            # Check if n is less than 2? Then we return an error message? But the problem doesn\\'t specify.\\n\\n   Given the time, and the problem asks for a brief example at the end, we\\'ll write the function for n>=3 and the example will be 10.\\n\\n   Steps:\\n\\n        Write is_prime:\\n\\n        def is_prime(x):\\n            if x < 2:\\n                return False\\n            if x == 2:\\n                return True\\n            if x % 2 == 0:\\n                return False\\n            i = 3\\n            while i * i <= x:\\n                if x % i == 0:\\n                    return False\\n                i += 2\\n            return True\\n\\n        Then the main function:\\n\\n        def find_closest_primes(n):\\n            # Find the smaller prime (less than n)\\n            smaller = n - 1\\n            while smaller >= 2:\\n                if is_prime(smaller):\\n                    break\\n                smaller -= 1\\n            # If we didn\\'t find any prime below n, then we set smaller to None? But we assume n>=3 so we should have found one.\\n            # Find the larger prime (greater than n)\\n            larger = n + 1\\n            while True:\\n                if is_prime(larger):\\n                    break\\n                larger += 1\\n\\n            print(f\"Smaller prime: {smaller}, Larger prime: {larger}\")\\n\\n        Then we call with an example: \\n            find_closest_primes(10)\\n\\n        This will print: Smaller prime: 7, Larger prime: 11\\n\\n   But note: what if n is prime? \\n        Example: n=7\\n            smaller: starts at 6 -> not prime, 5 -> prime -> so smaller=5\\n            larger: starts at 8 -> not prime, 9 -> not, 10->not, 11->prime -> larger=11\\n        So it prints: 5 and 11.\\n\\n        But the problem says \"the two closest prime numbers to it\". For 7, the primes are 5 and 11? but wait, 7 is prime itself. The closest primes: \\n            below: 5 (because 7-5=2) \\n            above: 11 (because 11-7=4) -> but wait, 7 is prime, so the next prime above is 11? but actually 11 is the next prime above 7? \\n            However, 8,9,10 are not primes -> so yes, 11 is the next.\\n\\n        But note: the prime 7 itself is not considered? because the problem says \"one smaller and one larger\". So we want primes strictly below and strictly above.\\n\\n   So the function works.\\n\\n   However, the problem says: \"prints the two closest prime number to it\". So we are printing the immediate next and immediate previous primes (not including n itself).\\n\\n   Let\\'s test with n=10: \\n        smaller: 9->not, 8->not, 7->prime -> 7\\n        larger: 11->prime -> 11\\n\\n   So we output 7 and 11.\\n\\n   We\\'ll write the code accordingly.\\n\\n   But note: the problem says \"a brief example at the end of the code\". So we can write:\\n\\n        # Example usage\\n        find_closest_primes(10)\\n\\n   However, the problem says: \"Answer with code only\". So we write the function and then the example call.\\n\\n   But note: the problem says \"write me a python function ... Include a brief example at the end of the code\"\\n\\n   So the entire code block should be:\\n\\n        [code for is_prime and find_closest_primes]\\n\\n        then the example call.\\n\\n   However, the problem says: \"Answer with code only\". So we write:\\n\\n        def is_prime(x):\\n            ... \\n\\n        def find_closest_primes(n):\\n            ...\\n\\n        find_closest_primes(10)\\n\\n   But note: the example call is part of the code? Yes.\\n\\n   Let me write the code.\\n\\n   Important: We have to be cautious for the prime check: we skip even numbers after 2.\\n\\n   Let\\'s code accordingly.\\n\\n   We\\'ll write:\\n\\n        def is_prime(x):\\n            if x < 2:\\n                return False\\n            if x == 2:\\n                return True\\n            if x % 2 == 0:\\n                return False\\n            i = 3\\n            while i * i <= x:\\n                if x % i == 0:\\n                    return False\\n                i += 2\\n            return True\\n\\n        def find_closest_primes(n):\\n            # Find the smaller prime (less than n)\\n            smaller = n - 1\\n            while smaller >= 2:\\n                if is_prime(smaller):\\n                    break\\n                smaller -= 1\\n            # If we didn\\'t find a prime below, then we set to None? But we assume n>=3 so we break the loop with a prime.\\n            # Find the larger prime (greater than n)\\n            larger = n + 1\\n            while True:\\n                if is_prime(larger):\\n                    break\\n                larger += 1\\n\\n            print(f\"Smaller prime: {smaller}, Larger prime: {larger}\")\\n\\n        # Example\\n        find_closest_primes(10)\\n\\n   However, what if n is 3?\\n        smaller: starts at 2 -> prime -> so smaller=2\\n        larger: starts at 4 -> not, 5 -> prime -> so larger=5\\n\\n        Output: Smaller prime: 2, Larger prime: 5\\n\\n   But wait, the prime 3 is the number itself? and the problem says \"one smaller and one larger\", so 2 is the only prime below 3? and 5 is the next prime above? \\n\\n   However, the next prime above 3 is 5? but 4 is not prime -> so yes.\\n\\n   But note: the prime 3 is prime, so the problem says \"the two closest prime numbers to it\" meaning distinct from n? so yes.\\n\\n   So the function is correct.\\n\\n   However, the problem says: \"the two closest prime numbers to it\". For n=3, the closest prime below is 2 (distance 1) and above is 5 (distance 2). But there is no prime between 3 and 5? so 5 is the next.\\n\\n   But note: the prime 3 itself is not considered? because the problem says \"one smaller and one larger\". So we don\\'t count n.\\n\\n   Therefore, the function is as above.\\n\\n   Let\\'s write the code.\\n\\n   One more corner: n=1? \\n        We assume n>=2? but if we get n=1, then smaller: 0 -> not prime, then -1 -> not prime -> then we break the loop without finding? Then smaller becomes 0? and then we print 0? which is not prime.\\n\\n   We\\'ll assume the input is at least 2.\\n\\n   Since the problem says \"an input number\", and the example is 10, we don\\'t worry about n=1.\\n\\n   Code:\\n\\n        We write the function as above.\\n\\n   Note: The problem says \"prints\", so we are printing.\\n\\n   Let\\'s write the code.\\n\\n   IMPORTANT: The problem says \"Answer with code only\". So we output the code.\\n\\n   We\\'ll write:\\n\\n        def is_prime(x):\\n            if x < 2:\\n                return False\\n            if x == 2:\\n                return True\\n            if x % 2 == 0:\\n                return False\\n            i = 3\\n            while i * i <= x:\\n                if x % i == 0:\\n                    return False\\n                i += 2\\n            return True\\n\\n        def find_closest_primes(n):\\n            smaller = n - 1\\n            while smaller >= 2:\\n                if is_prime(smaller):\\n                    break\\n                smaller -= 1\\n            larger = n + 1\\n            while True:\\n                if is_prime(larger):\\n                    break\\n                larger += 1\\n            print(f\"Smaller prime: {smaller}, Larger prime: {larger}\")\\n\\n        find_closest_primes(10)\\n\\n   But note: the problem says \"prints the two closest prime number\" (singular) but it\\'s two numbers. So we print two.\\n\\n   This should be the code.\\n\\n   Let me run in mind for n=10: \\n        smaller: 9 -> not prime, 8 -> not, 7 -> prime -> so smaller=7\\n        larger: 11 -> prime -> so larger=11\\n\\n   Output: \"Smaller prime: 7, Larger prime: 11\"\\n\\n   So it\\'s correct.\\n\\n   We output the code as described.\\n\\n   Note: The problem says \"Include a brief example at the end of the code\". We have an example call: find_closest_primes(10)\\n\\n   So the entire code block is as above.\\n\\n   However, the problem says \"Answer with code only\", so we write exactly the code.\\n\\n   Let me write it.\\n\\n   One more note: the problem says \"write me a python function\", so we have two functions? But the example call is not a function.\\n\\n   But the problem says: \"a python function\" (singular) but we have one function that does the job? Actually, the function is find_closest_primes, and we have an auxiliary is_prime.\\n\\n   Alternatively, we could write without is_prime as a helper? But the problem says \"a function\", but we have two functions? \\n\\n   However, the problem says \"write me a python function\", meaning one function? But the example call is part of the code.\\n\\n   Let me see: the problem says \"write me a python function\", so they might expect one function? But the example call is outside.\\n\\n   But the problem says: \"Include a brief example at the end of the code\". So we can have the function and then the example.\\n\\n   I think it\\'s acceptable.\\n\\n   Alternatively, we can write the function without a helper? But the helper is efficient.\\n\\n   We\\'ll keep it.\\n\\n   Final code:\\n</think>\\n\\ndef is_prime(x):\\n    if x < 2:\\n        return False\\n    if x == 2:\\n        return True\\n    if x % 2 == 0:\\n        return False\\n    i = 3\\n    while i * i <= x:\\n        if x % i == 0:\\n            return False\\n        i += 2\\n    return True\\n\\ndef find_closest_primes(n):\\n    smaller = n - 1\\n    while smaller >= 2:\\n        if is_prime(smaller):\\n            break\\n        smaller -= 1\\n    larger = n + 1\\n    while True:\\n        if is_prime(larger):\\n            break\\n        larger += 1\\n    print(f\"Smaller prime: {smaller}, Larger prime: {larger}\")\\n\\nfind_closest_primes(10)'"
